Prediction Methods: |
 Assumption; (Guilt by association[1])simlar drugs tend to have similar bahavior on target proteins.
 In our method, we first find the compounds (mainly in Drugbank dataset) that can 
 Bind and inhibit the target provided in the Challenge Question. For example, for Challenge Question 1, 
 we can find the following the compounds (Drugbank ID) bind their corresponding targets, we called them "existing" compounds;
 RET; DB08901 DB08896 DB00398
 BRAF; DB08912 DB08881 DB08896 DB00398 DB08881 
 SRC; DB06616 DB01254 DB09079 DB08901
 S6k; None
 MKNK1; None
 TTK; None
 ErK8; None
 PAK3; None
 PDK1; DB07132 DB07033 DB01933 DB00482 DB04522 DB03777 DB02010
 For PDK1, these compounds are not FDA approved, but we still extract their coumpund SMILE string for validation.
 And we predict the compounds in two step.
 step 1; we want to find the compounds have incitation behavior. 
 Thus, finding the "novel" compounds that are similar to "existing" compounds for target RET, BRAF, SRC, S6k
 step 2; remove the compounds in step 1 that are similar to PDK1's compounds, by doing that we avoid the "novel"
 compounds which have anti-targets behavior.
 Therefore, we extract other approved compounds (around 2000 compounds, but not include "existing" compounds) in Drugbank, 
 and measure the compounds similarity by use there chemical structure since chemical properties of a drug are evidently related to its ultimate therapeutic effect
 In this challenge, chemical structure of drug in Canonical SMILES form(Simplied Molecular Input Line Entry Specication) are downloaded
 from DrugBank. The Chemical Development Kit is then applied to computer the similarity of any two drugs as the Tanimoto
 score via their corresponding 2D chemical fingerprints [1]. After measuring the similarity score, we chose the top-5 compounds which have the largest similarity score.
 The same processes are applied to Challenge Question 2.

Rationale:
    Why is your approach innovative?: Guilt by association is widely used in drug-target prediction, it's simple and effectiveness.
    Why will your approach be generalizable?: The approach is generalizable since we only need the "existing" compounds' SMILE strings and measure chemical structure similarity.
