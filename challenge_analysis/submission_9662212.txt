        Prediction of Kinases Inhibition with Multi-task Ensemble Learning Model

        I obtained a dataset of inhibition assay on 15 enzymes that are targets and antitarget of Problem 1 and 2.
        Compounds in ZINC15 were filtered based on criteria below\:
        (1) Its purchasability is "in stock".
        (2) It satisfies at least 3 of 4 criteria in Lipinski's rule.
        (3) Its TPSA was smaller than 75 angstroms squared.

        Fingerprints were generated for each compound in the dataset.
        Here 8 kinds of fingerprints, namely ECFP, FCFP, Atom Pairs, Topological Torsion, Avalon and RDKit Fingerprint were generated on all compounds.
        Regression models of Random Forest were trained with each of fingerprints independently.
        Then the models were ensembled by a logistic regression model using stacked generalization.

        When a hash function was applied to the raw fingerprint, a technique proposed by Weinberger et al was adopted
        in order to solve the questions in multi-task learning paradigm.
        As a result, the single ensembled model predicted inhibition activity to all the enzymes.
        Expected values of scores were calculated for each compound in the library based on the probability estimates by the model.
        Finally, 5 compounds giving the highest expected values of score were submitted to the organizer of this challenge.

Rationale:
    Why is your approach innovative?: |
            (1) Ensemble of multiple fingerprints.
                While multiple learning algorithms are ensembled in usual stacked generalization,
                multiple fingerprints are done here. Better predictive performance is expected than each of individual fingerprints.
            (2) Hybrid of regression and classification.
                The ensembled model is composed of two kinds of learners\: Random Forest regressors and a logistic regression classifier.
                Each of the formers accepts a fingerprint as a feature vector, and predicts inhibition rates of each compound.
                Then the latter accepts predictions of the formers, and predict whether the inhibition rates are higher than threshold or not.
                Hereby the ensembled model is trained with quantitative data, and gives probabilities of binary classification at last.
                This mechanism enables to calculate expected values of scores with less information loss caused by binning of inhibition rates.
                
    Why will your approach be generalizable?: |
            If training data were provided, my model could be fitted to any targets and off-targets very easily.
            In addition, the single model could be generalizable to multiple problems because of multi-task learning.
            Actually Problem 1 and 2 were solved using a common model in this challenge.
