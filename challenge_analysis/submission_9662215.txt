Prediction Methods: Our methods are described in our project wiki and on google docs, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JEWeV99FDk1zwV5Hu4tRUYgSeJHPFpzqFj9MOZl3sU0/edit?usp=sharing . Solutions (compounds) are ranked from 1 to 5. Compounds have been checked for novelty and patentability.



Rationale:
    Why is your approach innovative?: We are confident that our approach represents one of the most rigorous methods of all submissions. 1) We tailored our workflow to every target and anti target, using benchmark data. 2) This was done for multiple models (statistical, structure based, and metadynamics). 3) Statistical models (biosignatures) trained on Janssen data were used, in general these models achieve a really predictive ROC compared with statistical models trained on public data (e.g. ROC ~0.95 compared with ROC ~0.8). 4) Metadynamics simulations gave us more confidence that the binding modes of compounds that we selected were stable.
    Why will your approach be generalizable?: In our lab we have used and are using comparable workflows for polypharmacology predictions. We have applied these workflows on different target classes such as enzymes and transmembrane receptors. By using large libraries containing compound and target information, our approach is generalizable to proteins with sufficient bioactvity data.
