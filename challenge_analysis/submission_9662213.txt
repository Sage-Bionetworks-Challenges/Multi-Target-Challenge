Prediction Methods: We built a triple classifier to predict the bioactivity of a compound to a target protein. 
    The classifier encodes both ligand molecules and target proteins by constructing a new end-to-end differentiable 
    neural net architecture, in which proteins are represented by amino acid sequence embedding and molecules 
    by fingerprint generated from graph convolutional neural network.

Rationale:
    Why is your approach innovative?: Graph convolutional neural network for molecular fingerprint is often used 
        as a deep learning model to predict the bioactive. As a ligand-based model, the inability to predict 
        bioactivity to a new target with few bioactive compounds constrains its generalization. 
        To build a more generalizable and useful deep model, we incorporate the feature from target proteins 
        by converting their amino acid sequence into “word embedding” vector and trained together with 
        molecular fingerprint generated from graph convolutional neural network. 
    Why will your approach be generalizable?: For a given new compound-target pair, our predictive model will classify 
        the bioactivity into potent, weak or inactive. Our deep model is trained on a high-quality dataset 
        and learns features from both ligands and targets, achieving a predictive accuracy of 0.91 on a external test set.
